You are actually going to be using FIJI.

## Scripting

You need to learn to script. Choosing regions of interest in which you will analyze your cells and cout them is critical. If you take videos, you are going to have very large datasets. Scripting is not only easy but it makes work faster and reproducible. 

To learn how to script, just find "record macro" and click. This will open a macro-recording window. Just do things in Fiji, and it will tell you what the analogous scripting commands are for those actions.

## Segmentation

One action that is not immediately scriptable is the action of drawing regions of interest. Please refer to the following links. Of particular interest should be the AI image-segmentation tool.
