# Kite

Kite is a new application that will expedite your journey writing code. The way to conceptualize Kite is as follows. Usually when you are programming, you have an object, and you wish to modify that object using a function. You may not know which function to use, so you check the documentation to try to find a function or you search the internet for the advice of those who have solved a similar problem. Kite was created by taking all of that information and using it to train a neural network. The neural network looks at what you last wrote and recommends what you would have found had you searched the internet or better because Kite has read more documents than you ever could feasibly have done.
